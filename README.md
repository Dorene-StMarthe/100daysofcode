<h2>Day 4, June 24 2020</h2>
<p>TODAYS PROGRESS: I learned how to create ordered and unordered lists in addition to creating dead links and place holder text.</p>
<p>THOUGHTS: Although I was not up to the challenge today, it feels so good to defeat the lazy monster and continue my learning journey. </p>
